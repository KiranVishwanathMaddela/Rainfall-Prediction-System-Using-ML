# Rainfall-Prediction-System-Using-ML
Rainfall prediction system using Machine Learning
●	Successfully developed and evaluated machine learning models for rainfall prediction, achieving significant accuracy in forecasting next-day rain based on specific atmospheric conditions.
●	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on India's weather data to identify patterns and correlations between atmospheric conditions and rainfall occurrences.
●	Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train-test split method from Scikit-learn, enabling evaluation of model performance and generalization to new data.
●	Technologies Used: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Collaboratory, NumPy, Pandas, sklearn, Linear regression and Random Forest algorithm
